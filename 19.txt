explains Jon Wiley, a search designer who is part of an initiative to revamp Google's desing philosophy 
that was luanched by Larry Page when he became chief executive in 2011.

由远及近的原则
几十年来，缅甸一直是亚太地区最孤立的国家之一。但昂山素季本周 将从仰光飞往泰国曼谷访问，对于质疑缅甸改革诚意的人来说，
此行历史意义重大，反映该国确实正在推行大规模变革

It is a brief flight---a little over an hour--yet by taking it, the once-repressed icon of Myanmese freedom will travel light years 
from her former days under house arrest in her rambling mansion, cut off from her two sons and her husband, not to mention the outside world.

昂山素季是缅甸民主运动代表人物，一度饱受压迫，被软禁家中，无法与两个儿子和丈夫见面，与外界更是完全隔绝。
她前往曼谷的航程只要一个多小时，但却象征了缅甸巨大的进步。
